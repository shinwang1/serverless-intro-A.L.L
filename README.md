# C-plus-plus-Cinder-A.L.L

## Part-1
To compile the main.cpp file, in your terminal type:
    
    g++ main.cpp

This will create an executable file in the same directory.  
To run the executable, in your terminal type:

    ./a.out

If you wish to name the executable, when compiling you can specify by running:

    g++ main.cpp -o <name>

## Part-2
Part 2 uses Xcode to compile and run. (You will need Xcode installed)  
To open the project, open the part-2.xcodeproj in xcode.  
You can also open in the terminal by typing:

    open part-2.xcodeproj

You can then write your code in the main.cpp file just like normal and use Xcode to build and run.
